1.)what is the differnece between findelement and findelements?

findElement single webelement present returns single element 
findElements  single webelement present returns single element

findElement multiple  webelement present returns first element
findElement multiple webelement present returns all element

Element not present Throws no such elemnet exception
Element not present does not throws any exception returns zero element

Return type weblement ,  Return type List weblement 
Acesss Direct , iterate list of webelement


2.) what is sanity and smoke testing

smoke testing verfies the criticl functionality of the application like start application
sanity testing verfies the new functionality and bugs have been fixed or not

smoke testing the objective of the testing is to verify the stability of the system in order to proceed with more rigorous tesing
sanity testing the objective of the testing is to verify the rationality 

smoke testing this testing is performend by testers and devlopers
sanity testing  this testing is performend by testers

smoke testing  is a subset of acceptance testing
sanity testing  is a subset of regression testing

3.)what is re testing and regression testing?

Regression testing is testing existing software applications to make sure that a change or addition hasn't 
broken any existing functionality.
usually we do retesting in the following cases:

new function are added
change requirment (in the organization)
Defect fixing
performance issue fix
environment changes (updated db from mysql to oracle)

Retesting 
To ensure that the defects which we were found in the earlier build were fixied or not in the current build

4.) what is end to end testing
testing overall functionalites of the system including the data integration amoung all the modules is called end to end testing

5.)what is exploratory testing

exploratory testing is all about discovering and investigation and learning
testcases are not created in adnvanced but tester check the system on the fly
the fouces of the exp testing is more about thinking activity

6.) adhoc testing
adhoc testing is informal testing with aim to break the system
this testing is usually unplaned activity

7.) differenc between exploratory testing and adhoc testing
