1.)what is the differnece between findelement and findelements?

findElement single webelement present returns single element 
findElements  single webelement present returns single element

findElement multiple  webelement present returns first element
findElement multiple webelement present returns all element

Element not present Throws no such elemnet exception
Element not present does not throws any exception returns zero element

Return type weblement ,  Return type List weblement 
Acesss Direct , iterate list of webelement


2.) what is sanity and smoke testing

smoke testing verfies the criticl functionality of the application like start application
sanity testing verfies the new functionality and bugs have been fixed or not

smoke testing the objective of the testing is to verify the stability of the system in order to proceed with more rigorous tesing
sanity testing the objective of the testing is to verify the rationality 

smoke testing this testing is performend by testers and devlopers
sanity testing  this testing is performend by testers

smoke testing  is a subset of acceptance testing
sanity testing  is a subset of regression testing

3.)what is re testing and regression testing?

Regression testing is testing existing software applications to make sure that a change or addition hasn't 
broken any existing functionality.
usually we do retesting in the following cases:

new function are added
change requirment (in the organization)
Defect fixing
performance issue fix
environment changes (updated db from mysql to oracle)

Retesting 
To ensure that the defects which we were found in the earlier build were fixied or not in the current build

4.) what is end to end testing
testing overall functionalites of the system including the data integration amoung all the modules is called end to end testing

5.)what is exploratory testing

exploratory testing is all about discovering and investigation and learning
testcases are not created in adnvanced but tester check the system on the fly
the fouces of the exp testing is more about thinking activity

6.) adhoc testing
adhoc testing is informal testing with aim to break the system
this testing is usually unplaned activity

7.) differenc between exploratory testing and adhoc testing

      adhoc testing tester should now the application functionality
      exploratory testing tester doesnt now the application functionality
      
      adhoc testing intension is to break the application/ find out the corner defects 
      exploratory testing intension is to explore the application

      adhoc testing anyapplication
      exploratory testing anyapplication which is new to testers
8.) explain SDLC and STLC
      SDLC ==>Requirment analysis==>Design==>Devlopment==>testing==> maintenance
      STLC==>Requirment analysis==>Test Plane==>Test case Devlopment==>Environment setup==>Test execution==>Test cycle closure
      
      Sdlc is the complete devlopment process in that we have stlc
      
      

9.)Explain bug life cycle
 report the bug ==>is it not produceble or invalid ==No==>close the bug =Yess==>assign the priority and direct to concer dev
 is Defect valid =No==> close the bug =Yes==>Need fix imediatley ?
 =Yes==>Fix the bug=No==>Shedule defect for futre realse
 Fix the bug ==>send for validation on new build==>validate the defect==>is defect fixed=Yes==>cloase the bug=No==>reject the defect
 
 
 10.)a)Low Severity and high priority 
  Logo error can be low severity coz it cannot affect functionality but it can be high priority coz you dont want any furthur 
  thing to proceed with wrong loga

  if the user name is enetered wrong in login page it can be low severity as it is spelling mistake but high priority because
  its high visiblity
  b)high sevirty and low priority
  if application crashes after mulitifle use of any functionality eg save button is creshed after 200 times than
  it as high sevirty because appplication creshed but low priority because no need to debug right now
  
 c.) high sevirty with high priority
  if application is not allowed to login with correct credintion than it has high priority with high severity
