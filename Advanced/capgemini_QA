1.)companents involved in test plan?
2.)smoke testing vs sanity testing
3.)difference between test cases and test scenario
4.) what will yo call the type of testing which helps one to know about the application
      Adaptability testing
5.)what is defuct leakage?
    defuct leakage is the matrize which helps to identify the efficency of the QA testing like how many defuts are missed and
    slipped during the qa testing
    Defuct leakage=(no of defuct found in UAT/no of defuct found By QA)
6.)what is incremantal model ?
7.) what is requirement traceability matrix?
8.) what are different testing model
    water model, v model, agile model, spiral model , iterative model, rad model
8.)how to execute a particular test method for 5 times?
    @Test(invocationCount =5)
    
9.) what is interface

  an interface in java is blueprint of a class it as static as constant and abstract method 
  interface as abstract method and variable but it cannot have method body
  
10.) what is abstract 
    abstract is process of hidding the implementation details and show only fnctionality to the user
    
11.) what is encapsulation?
      encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping the data and code together into a single unit for example a capsule which
      is mixed to several medicins
      we can also create a fully encapsulation class by making all the data members of the class to private now we can use
      getter and setter method to set and get the data in
      
12.)Advantage of sing testng over junit?
      there are three major advantages of testng over junit
      annotation are easier to understand
      test cases can be grouped more esily
      parllel testing is possiable
